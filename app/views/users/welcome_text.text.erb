Dear <%= @contact_name %>,

A new <%= @title %> account named <%= @name %>
has been created for your organization. Use the link below to
generate a password. This password reset link is only valid
for the next 24 hours.

<%= @url %>

After logging in you can immediately use the new account. Contact
DataCite Support (support@datacite.org) if you have any questions.

You can always generate a new password reset link by going to
<%= @reset_url %> and entering <%= @name %> as account ID.

Thanks,

The DataCite Support Team
